# React Sample Site Example

This is an example website which uses a Cloud CMS sample project as a backend and a React application as its frontend. 

To run, in the react/sample directory:

1. Add your `gitana.json` file. You can get it by: Creating a sample project > Manage Project > API Keys
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build` to build the react app. (`npm run build-dev` for a development build)
4. Run `npm start` to start the app server.
5. Navigate to localhost:2999

This example is not intended for production use, but rather to demonstrate how Cloud CMS might integrate with your React application.
