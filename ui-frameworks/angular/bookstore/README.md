## AngularJS Example Bookstore Site

This is an example website which uses a Cloud CMS sample project as a backend and an AngularJS application as its frontend.

To run, in the angular/sample directory:

1. Add your `gitana.json` file. You can get it by: Creating a sample project > Manage Project > API Keys
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular
4. Run `npm build` to build the Angular app
5. Run `node app` to start the app server.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:2999

This example is not intended for production use, but rather to demonstrate how Cloud CMS might integrate with your AngularJS application.
