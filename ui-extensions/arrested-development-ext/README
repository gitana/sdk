# Arrested Development UI for Cloud CMS

This extensions package is intended for the on-premise Docker installation of Cloud CMS.

It demonstrates how to extend the user interface at a deeper level to provide some additional whitelabel and custom
capabilities.

## Installation

To install this:

1.  In your Docker "ui" service configuration, mount this folder into the Docker container like this:

Example:
```
  ui:
    build: ./ui
    networks:
      - cloudcms
    depends_on:
      - api
    env_file:
      - ./ui/ui.env
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - /{path_to_this_folder}:/var/app/current/ext
```

Where "path_to_this_folder" should be replaced with the path to the current directory.

2.  Edit the `ui.env` file and add the following:

    CLOUDCMS_UI_EXT_PATH=./ext
    CLOUDCMS_UI_EXT_REPLACE=true

This tells the user interface to pick up the extensions from the `./ext` path.
This path resolves to `/var/app/current/ext`.

This also tells Cloud CMS to completely replace the application config with the contents from `./ext`.

## Testing

Once you've done that, restart your Docker process.  You may also want to rebuild your Docker images to be sure
you're picking up all the latest changes.

    docker-compose down
    docker-compose build --force-rm
    docker-compose up

Then load up the UI and you'll see a completely different theme.  The logos have been changed, the branding is different.
Even the quotes and waiting icons have been adjusted.
