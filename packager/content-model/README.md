        Replace cloudcms-subdomain, username and password in cloudcms-login.sh with your own

        From Cloud CMS, go to your project
        From Manage Project / Stack, select content repository
        The url contains the repository ID
        copy the repository id to deploy-content-model.sh line #11 where is sets REPOSITORY_ID="your-repostiory-id-here"
